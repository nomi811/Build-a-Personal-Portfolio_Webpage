### Objectives
This is a freeCodeCamp project assignment.

If you'd like to see my progress and other projects I've done, go to my [freeCodeCamp page.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/nomi811)

Our assignment was to build a one page portfolio webpage with navigation links, and showing the projects we've done.

I found a free Bootstrap theme that I customized.

### Technologies
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (that came with the theme)

### Final Remarks
When I started this project, I took the lines of code piece by piece and added them to my project if I needed them.  This helped me to understand and learn better what everything was doing.  Plus, I didn't want a bunch of code included in my project that wasn't doing anything.  That being said, I still don't understand all the code that is being used by the theme that I included in my project.  It works.  And that was the goal.
